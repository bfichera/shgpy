# ShgPy

ShgPy is an open-source software toolkit for the analysis of rotational anisotropy second harmonic generation (RA-SHG) data. It is designed to facilitate the refinment of RA-SHG datasets requiring large numbers of fitting parameters.

ShgPy depends on three packages -- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), and [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) -- which provide access to a combination of fast array-manipulation tools, optimization routines, and symbolic manipulation capabilities.
