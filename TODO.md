# To do

- [ ] Make sure every function can accept a Path instance (for example, everything in ``fformgen.py``)
- [x] Document that the tensors are sometimes defined differently in the case of quadrupole compared to dipole.
- [x] Make functions in formgen, etc. not redundant
- [x] Make one able to generate a cost function independently.
