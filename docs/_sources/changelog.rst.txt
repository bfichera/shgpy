Changelog
=========

v0.8.1
------
- Added multiprocessing compatibility to model and cost function generation.

v0.8.0
------
- Rewrote the Fourier formula generation process. Previously ``sympy`` had a bug which made computing the Fourier transforms of typical SHG formulas incredibly slow. The previous workaroud was to compute the Fourier transforms of a general SHG tensor ahead of time (i.e. the "uncontracted Fourier transforms"), and then having the user generate a full Fourier formula for their specific system using a contraction of this tensor. A different workaround which I was not able to implement until now is to enumerate all the possible terms that could appear in a viable SHG formula (i.e. arbitrary products of sines and cosines), and then create a lookup table for their respective Fourier transforms for access at runtime. This is now implemented in :func:`shgpy.core.data_handler.form_to_fform`. My initial tests suggest that, while it is still slightly slower than the previous workaround, not only is it much simpler for the user, but it also makes it trivial to compute the Fourier transforms of higher multiple SHG formulas (i.e. magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole contributions). This is now documented in the tutorials and examples.
- Added the ability to generate the raw cost functions or model functions from the Fourier formulas. This is useful in case the user wants to use a different wrapper around ``scipy.optimize`` like LMFIT (which I highly recommend!).
- Real-space formula generation is now implemented as a single function: :func:`shgpy.formgen.formgen`. This function handles electric dipole, magnetic dipole, and electric quadrupole tensors through three arguments (`t_eee`, `t_mee`, and `t_qee`, respectively).
    - Note: this is the first release in which users are able to calculate the magnetic dipole contribution.
- Added `copy` and `as_pandas` methods to containers
- Added `filter` method to :func:`shgpy.core.data_handler.DataContainer`.
- Added `apply_arbitrary_scale` method to :func:`shgpy.core.data_handler.FormContainer` and :func:`shgpy.core.data_handler.fFormContainer`.
- Added multiple example files demonstrating the above.


v0.7.10
-------
- Fixed a bug associated with the rounding of prefactors in :func:`shgpy.fformgen.generate_contracted_fourier_transforms` (i.e. the `ndigits` parameter).

v0.7.8
------
- Added the ability to apply Kleinman symmetry to a particular SHG tensor (i.e. enforce full permutation symmetry of the susceptibility indices). Use :func:`shgpy.particularize` with the option `permute_all_indices=True`

v0.7.6
------
- Added xlabel and ylabel axes to :func:`shgpy.plotter.easy_plot`

v0.7.5
------
- Fixed a number of tensors which were incorrectly defined due to typos in Boyd. The affected tensors were
    - `D_6` (dipole)
    - `C_4` (quadrupole)
    - `C_4h` (quadrupole)
    - `S_4` (quadrupole)

v0.7.0
------
- Officially transitioned to supporting only tensors for which all the involved symbols are purely real, as defined by ``sympy`` assumptions. This got rid of a lot of redundancy in function definitions, such as ``shgpy.fformgen.generate_contracted_fourier_transforms`` versus ``shgpy.fformgen.generate_contracted_fourier_transforms_complex``, ``shgpy.formgen.formgen_dipole_quadrupole_real`` and ``shgpy.formgen.formgen_dipole_quadrupole_complex``, ect. In all cases, these functions have been replaced by a single function, e.g. ``shgpy.formgen.formgen_dipole_quadrupole``, and you will receive a ``NotImplementedError`` if you try to use any of the replaced definitions.

- To aid in explicitly defining the reality of SHG tensors, added ``shgpy.make_tensor_real`` to complement ``shgpy.make_tensor_complex``.

- Transitioned to compiling cost functions at runtime by generating C code with ``sympy.ulities.codegen``. This is a workaround to the fact that complicated ``sympy.lambdify`` functions are very slow to evaluate.

- Added the ability to generate a cost function independently with :func:`shgpy.fformfit.gen_cost_func` and use it in one of the fitting routines by the ``load_cost_func_filename`` argument.

- Added ``shgpy.fformfit.dual_annealing_fit`` and ``shgpy.fformfit.dual_annealing_fit_with_bounds``.


v0.6.1
------
- Added the ability to optionally send arguments to the ``scipy.optimize.basinhopping`` function. This is useful e.g. for debugging -- use

>>> basinhopping_kwargs = {'disp':True}

to send ``disp=True`` to ``scipy.optimize.basinhopping``, which initializes verbose output.

v0.5.1
------
- Fixed a bug related to the change in v0.5.0 in which :func:`shgpy.load_fform` wasn't compatible with the new pickling scheme.

v0.5.0
------
- In ``.p`` file handling, switched from pickling pure ``sympy`` expressions in :mod:`shgpy.fformgen` to pickling string represetations of those expressions generated using ``sympy.srepr``. This is a workaround to a ``sympy`` / ``pickle`` bug in which unpickling ``sympy`` expressions will cause ``sympy`` to conflate objects like ``sympy.Symbol('x')`` with ``sympy.Symbol('x', real=True)``.

- To use v0.5.0, you will have to remake your ``.p`` files.
