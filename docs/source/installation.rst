Installation
============

Installing ShgPy is easy! Just run::

    $ pip install shgpy

You may now want to edit some configuration files. This is mostly
necessary if you want to control where the logs are going (if you 
don't care, feel free to skip this sections). This configuration
is located in the python package folder in the file
``_logging_config.py``. See the `python logging documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html>`_
for more info.
